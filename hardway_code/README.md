# PythonTheHardWay
Repo Consists of all the exercise that were provided in the Zed Shaw's book Learn Python the Hard way. 

Exercises seem simple enough and repetitive in the beginning. When you reach Classes and Object Oriented,the benefit is evident. 
All your doubts regarding the OOP will pragmatically get answered. After that, you get to create your own game (text oriented).
When you see your code, the code you type come alive the feeling is "Pure Confidence". In the later exercises where programs span multiple pages.
To get these code execute perfectly, and see the results itself is a pure joy.  

# Type every character of these programs by yourself.

You will learn Python and be confident to tackle any problem with it. (You can use good IDEs, it will make your life a bit easier)

To type out the code, after understanding what needs to be done in the exercise,it took less than 24 hours to complete the exercises. 

# Why I shared the Repo, if all code needs to be typed? 

Inspiration and Motivation. If I can do, then you can do much better than me. Take up the Challenge.
