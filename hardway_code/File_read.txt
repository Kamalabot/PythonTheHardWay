This is stuff I typed into a file.
It is really cool stuff.
Lots and lots of fun to have in here.

16 Exercises have passed. Things memorable are
f-strings
file reading
Using """
Using python -m pydoc function
Rigorous use of input() function 
Reducing the code to single line challenges boosted my confidence...
Oh, it also thought me to be careful about the way I refer to the arguments. 
I lost the data that I had typed into the file that I wanted to read.
